![Dutch PHP Conference](/assets/2015-04-20/dpc-small.png)

Dutch PHP Conference is probably one of the most respectful and exciting PHP community events in Europe.
We have a lot of good friends in the Benelux community and we thought
it would be great to sponsor DPC after our sponsoring PHP Benelux back in January
and PHP Tour in Luxembourg coming up in May.

DPC will take place in Amsterdam on June 25, 26 & 27, 2015.

<!--more-->
DPC is a three day event with high-level technical sessions. Schedule is already online and features talks on
Symfony, Meteor, MySQL, Security, Ansible, Varnish, Behat, AngularJS, Docker, Unit testing, and more.

First day is a tutorial day where you can learn about
Symfony2 CMF, JavaScript, MySQL, Security, Varnish, ELK stack, Behat, CQRS, AngularJS, testing and more. 

Attendees also have the opportunity to join the [Codenight](http://www.phpconference.nl/codenight),
an extensive hackathon where they can code on a specific project. 

The continuousphp Team will have a booth there.
If Continuous Delivery for your PHP projects is already in place or if you are ready to do the big jump,
come to discuss with us!
