Check out the continuousphp Phing tasks on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/continuousphp/phing-tasks). 

<!--more-->

Phing is already extensively supported by continuousphp.
To go even further, we now provide our users with a set of Phing tasks so that they can get the URL of
the latest stable package of their project, and download it. These tasks are available on
[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/continuousphp/phing-tasks).
