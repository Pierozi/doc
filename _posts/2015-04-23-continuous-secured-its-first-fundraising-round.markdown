__Continuous S.A. just achieved its first fundraising;
this first round will enable the company to develop its integration platform both on a technical and a sales level.__

__Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg - April 23, 2015.__ Continuous S.A.,
company created in October 2014 by [Frederic Dewinne](/about-us/#fdewinne),
[Oswald De Riemaecker](/about-us/#oswaldderiemaecker) and [Pascal Paulis](/about-us/#ppaulis), three PHP solution experts,
just announced that their first round of fundraising is completed, thanks to private investors. 

continuousphp allows developers to rely on a solid platform to build, package, test and deploy web applications in PHP.
The PHP programming language powers 80% of the Web and the company is willing to develop this solution so that
it becomes a trusted tool for Continuous Integration & Delivery of PHP projects in the whole world.

The solution relies on several acclaimed technologies, both by developers and SysAdmins, such as Phing, Composer, GitHub,
Bitbucket, Docker and many others. Amazon Web Services is also in this list as continuousphp is based on this Cloud offer.
continuousphp offers a very easy and intuitive way to use all these technologies in the same workflow.

The continuousphp project started in May 2013, and was self-funded at that time,
when it won the Luxembourg StartUp Weekend where the three associates presented their solution and their willingness
to create a company which would allow them to develop and sell their platform.
The three founders then participated in November 2014 to [Seed4Start](http://www.seed4start.org/),
a French-Luxembourgish venture capital forum, where they started their fundraising campaign.
This event allowed them to meet their first investors who understood the interest of their solution and the perfect timing
to launch it. Investors from this first round have very different profiles, from IT consultants to high level executives.
No VC’s were involved in this first round.  

Continuous S.A. is based at Technoport, a business incubator located in Belval,
where Luxembourg State invested 500 millions Euros to build the largest business place in the Grande Region.
This structure allowed continuousphp to establish contracts with luxembourgish institutions,
other companies located in the incubator and to benefit from existing partnerships between Technoport and Microsoft BizPark,
PayPal and Amazon Web Services.

This fundraising allows Continuous S.A. to recruit Sales and Marketing people and to continuously develop its platform
to integrate new functionalities and third-party technologies.

Moreover, the company planned to start its international expansion after 2017, but some contracts and partnerships are
already signed outside Luxembourgish borders. One of these contracts was signed with Zend Technologies, a major player
in the PHP ecosystem, so that continuousphp can benefit from this company’s technology and support.

__About Continuous S.A.__  
Continuous S.A. is a Luxembourgish company created in 2014. It offers the continuousphp© platform which allows to build,
package, test and deploy PHP applications in the same workflow.
