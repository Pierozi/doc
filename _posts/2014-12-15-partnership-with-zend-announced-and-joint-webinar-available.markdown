![Zend Solution Partner](/assets/2014-12-15/zend-solution-partner.png "Zend Solution Partner")

Knowing that continuousphp uses [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) and supports [Zend Server](http://www.zend.com/en/products/server), we had to straighten our relationship with [Zend Technologies](http://www.zend.com/), the PHP Company.  
We are very proud to announce that continuousphp is now a Zend Solution Partner.

<!--more-->

This partnership brings us an even better worldwide visibility and a dedicated support from Zend, which brings a great value for our customers.

The first action we did together was to deliver a webinar about continuousphp where [bookmylimo.com](https://bookmylimo.com), one of our customers, presented their implementation of our solution.

[Watch the webinar to find out how they use continuousphp](http://www.zend.com/en/webinars/recorded/show/2533_take+advantage+of+a+continuous+deployment+environment+by+lmplementing+git-flow+in+the+cloud) *(login required)*
