continuousphp's UI will look different in a few weeks from now. Again, we involved some users to  find out what they expect from our platform.       

<!--more-->

We have worked with some candid new users, video-taped them and analyzed their behavior as they discovered continuousphp and tried to set up their first project on continuousphp. 

Our good friends at [Do apps](http://doapps.lu/) helped us in redesigning everything so that any new user can easily find his way through our PaaS and use it.
