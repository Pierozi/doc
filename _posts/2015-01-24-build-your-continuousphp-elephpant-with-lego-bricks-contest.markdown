To bring some fun to our booth at PHP Benelux, we organized a Lego-elephant contest.  
The idea was to build an elephpant with Lego bricks in 10 minutes.

continuousphp was one of the lucky companies to sponsor [PHP Benelux](https://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2015/).  
This great event is an unmissable PHP conference in Europe.  
As we love elephpants, Lego bricks and encourage team work,
we put a contest in place where mastering all of our passions was needed to win.

Winners got selected thanks to retweets they had. We’ve been impressed by the pieces of art some attendees did.

Congrats guys!
