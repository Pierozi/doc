![Build passed](/assets/2015-04-10/continuousphp-repo-status.png)

continuousphp again got a little bit better!  
For every branch of your repository, you can now publish a Build Status Label
that shows the result of the most recent build.

As the owner or maintainer of a project, the status images help you to prove the stability of your application.  
It's a quality label that shows that Quality Assurance is important in your product and that you're transparent
about its current status.

To obtain the status image code, simply go to your project's page and click on the button "Status Image".  
The Status Labels are available inside your project as URL, HTML or Markdown-Code.  
e.g. you can use the Markdown-Code in the README.md file of your repository to show the status image
on your repository's page on GitHub or Bitbucket.
