As you may already know, continuousphp is involved in the organization of PHP Tour Luxembourg.
PHP Tour was created a few years back by the French speaking community [AFUP](http://afup.org).

The event will take place in our home country on May 12 & 13 in the beautiful
[Abbey Neum√ºnster](http://www.neimenster.lu/en/Culture/Pratical-information/Contact).

Program was unveiled a few days ago and one of the talks we submitted was selected.
[Oswald de Riemaecker](/about-us/#oswaldderiemaecker) will present a session about
the creation of a development and production environment using AWS, Chef, Vagrant and Docker.

continuousphp will also have a booth there where you can stop by to discuss Continuous Delivery
and Agile methodologies.
