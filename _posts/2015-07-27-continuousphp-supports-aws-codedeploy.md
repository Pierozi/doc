continuousphp just added the ability to deploy your app using AWS CodeDeploy.   

<!--more-->

continuousphp now supports AWS CodeDeploy. For this, we have developed a Chef cookbook to easily install AWS CodeDeploy on your systems, whether it is on premise or on EC2 instances. It currently supports Ubuntu 14.04, CentOs 7, Fedora 21 and, of course, Amazon Linux.
