Here’s the one-minute pitch that won our votes:

> Producing today’s web applications involves a team of experts but it can be a very expensive investment
if their productivity hampered.  
> As a business owner, you want to make sure that your team is maximizing their time creating and producing features
and enhancements directly improving your product.  
> But actually, developers that spending up to 2 days a week working on tasks and projects that are hampering
their productivity.  
> Things like installing, configuring and maintaining software tools, servers, DevOps, the list goes on…  
>  
> As sweet brown made famous: Ain’t nobody got time for that!  
>  
> continuousphp is our team’s goal to build a Platform as a Service that automates a team’s software delivery process.
This will save PHP developers valuable time to work on building product.  
>
