With the Continuous Deploy Agent, you can now easily implement a complete Continuous Deployment pipeline for your
on-premise servers.

Continuous Deployment pipeline and deliver your application on your on-premise servers.
Together with [continuousphp](https://continuousphp.com), it will take care of the deployment workflow to run after
a successful build of your application.
