It was on our roadmap and it was also a highly requested feature. It makes us even more than happy to announce that continuousphp now supports [Pull Requests for GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)!

continuousphp will automatically start a build when a user makes or updates a pull request to your repository. It will notify you about the build status directly in your GitHub account. This will ease your review process and project contribution validations.
