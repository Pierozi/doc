We just updated our Team page so that our bios reflect all our knowledge and skills. Take a look to get to know us.

At continuousphp, we value professional certifications as we believe it - partly - shows what individuals master. This is why our technical team has many certifications in various domains: PHP, Zend Framework, Scrum, AWS and Red Hat SysAdmin. Their knowledge is obviously far beyond this list.  
  
When it comes to CI, CD, DevOps and PHP, we know what we're talking about!
