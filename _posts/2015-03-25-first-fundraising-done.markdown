We really want to thank our investors for their trust in our solution.
Looking for fundraisers was a great adventure which is now behind us, for the first round at least!

<!--more-->
This first round of investment allows us to increase our outreach to the entire world with an over-motivated Sales
and Marketing entity. The platform itself will also benefit from this as we now have two more engineers fully devoted
to enhance our solution in terms of new features and supported technologies.

We will also be able to attend international IT tradeshows to demo our solutions and show how
it addresses a critical need for automation. We will also provide our customers with
a lot of professional content as it is key for a technical solution to offer tutorials and videos to prospects.
