To celebrate 20th birthday of PHP, continuousphp added support for PHP 1.0! Search your old hard drives to work on
your old PHP 1 projects!

<!--more-->

For the 20th birthday of our favorite language, we thought we should do something fun and cool to celebrate this
important milestone. So we looked back at what has been done for the past 20 years and can't missed that the language
evolved tremendously and that you can do things that were completely impossible back then or do them
in a completely differentway. 

So the idea was to offer you the ability to handle PHP 1.0 projects on continuousphp and code like in the good old days,
with a modern platform.

Then, we gave a second thought about it and decided that maybe something would be ever better than this: PHP7!

So instead of playing with your old PHP 1.0 projects, you can now handle PHP 7 ones on continuousphp.

Enjoy!
