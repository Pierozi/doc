[Mind & Market](http://www.mindandmarket.com/) is a web platform that enables networking between innovative project owners or innovative companies with established entrepreneurs, potential investors, coaches and mentors. Several meeting forums with pitch sessions are organized throughout the year in Belgium.

The first Luxembourguese edition of Mind & Market took place this week, under the patronage of Deloitte, The National Research Fund Luxembourg (FNR), Luxinnovation - the national agency for innovation and research, and the University of Luxembourg.

50 startups were gathered to present their project in front of business angels, investors, public administrations and university people.

continuousphp was part of the IT Services category. Oswald De Riemaecker, our CEO, presented our PaaS and... we won the Jury Award! Offered by [Alter Domus](http://www.alterdomus.com/), a leading European provider of Fund and Corporate Services.

That's another one on our win list!
