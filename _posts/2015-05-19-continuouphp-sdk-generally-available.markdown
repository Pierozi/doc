Check out the continuousphp SDK on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/continuousphp/sdk). 

<!--more-->

As continuousphp is 100% focused on Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery, we created a SDK 
that you can use at will to take advantage of continuousphp by consuming our [API](http://docs.continuousphp.apiary.io/).
It is really interesting if you want to create your own dashboard.
  
Of course, this SDK is open source.
  
[Get the package here](https://packagist.org/packages/continuousphp/sdk)
