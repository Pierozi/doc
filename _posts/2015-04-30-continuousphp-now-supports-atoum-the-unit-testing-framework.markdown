![atoum](/assets/2015-04-30/atoum.png)

We are very pleased to announce that continuousphp users can now unit test their apps using atoum.

<!--more-->

atoum is a well-known framework to run unit tests. We had many users who asked for its integration with continuousphp. As we also think that this a great tool to use, we did it.

One of our first users is already very enthusiastic about it:

<blockquote>
atoum offers a very easy way to make strong suite test, I'm happy to do that now with continuousphp. The team was very reactive with integrating atoum within their solution.

</blockquote>

Now you can either use atoum, PHPUnit or SimpleTest to run your tests on continuousphp. Choice is yours!
