Docker is a virtual software container platform which allows to package applications and their dependencies
in order to execute them on any Linux server. Connected to a remote versioning server, it eases application maintenance
and its system configuration on multiple environments.  
At the end of this training course, trainees will have a clear understanding of all concepts around Docker
and will be able to use it in their environment.
